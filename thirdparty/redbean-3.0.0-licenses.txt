This file contains the license notices found within Redbean, retrieved by get-bean-licenses.lua in the funcWebWiki repository.
The source code to Redbean and these dependencies appears to be held in the monolithic https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan repository.
As a Redbean binary does not contain the license text as required by many of these licenses, the following acknowledgements are made:
	Cosmopolitan: license shipped in Redbean
	largon2 (MIT License): no license conditions shipped - mit-license.txt is shipped as a good-faith effort
	lsqlite3 (MIT License): lsqlite3.txt
	TRE regex (BSD-2 License): tre.txt
	libmaxminddb (Apache 2.0): maxmind.txt
	Lua 5.4.6 (MIT License): lua.txt

	Optimized Routines (MIT License): optimized-routines.txt
	Chromium (BSD-3 License): This was eventually tracked down to third_party/zlib/adler32_simd.c and related. It is therefore covered by Redbean's copyright notice (for year) and by zlib.txt (for text).
